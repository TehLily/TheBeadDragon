<p class="intro">Many of the early peoples that prepared and consumed cocoa used it as a sort of medication. While we no longer consider it to be medicine, there are plenty of health benefits to cocoa, as long as we limit the amount of sugar and fats added to it when it is made into chocolate. A product containing at least 72% cocoa is recommended to get the most health benefits from your chocolate or cocoa powder.

<h3>Benefits of Cocoa Include:</h3>

	<dl class="benefits">

	<dt>Better Cognative Skills</dt>
	
	<dd>Cocoa may help with general cognition, memory, and attention, even in people suffering from insufficient sleep.</dd>

	<dt>Immune System Support</dt>
	
	<dd>Iron, zinc, and selenium are minerals found in cocoa that help maintain your immune system. Selenium in particular can help reduce the negative radiotherapy side effects in cancer treatments. If your chocolate is 90% cocoa or more, the zinc content is high enough to improve wound healing as well.</dd>

	<dt>Improved Nerve and Muscle Functions</dt>
	
	<dd>Cocoa also has magnesium, which helps regulate and protect nerve cells involved with muscle function.</dd>

	<dt>Reduce Risk of Heart Disease</dt>
	
	<dd>Dark chocolate contains a flavonoid called flavonol that helps lower blood 	pressure, improves the flow of blood, and prevents damage to blood cells.</dd>

	<dt>Regulate Weight Loss</dt>
	
	<dd>Cocoa by itself has a high concentration of phytonutrients and is low in fat and sugar, meaning the calories from pure cocoa are nutrient-dense. Cocoa can also increase feelings of fullness, leading to decreased overall calorie consumption. Of course, any sugars or fats added to the chocolate should be considered as well.</dd>
