<p class="intro">The first cacao plants originated in Mesoamerica (modern-day Mexico) some 4,000 years ago. By 600 AD, the early Latin America civilations, like the Olmec, used cacao seeds to make drinks. These drinks were bitter as they did not included any sweetener, and were often spiced with peppers or thickened with corn. The drink, called <em>xocoatl</em>, was taken as medicine to heal both physical and spiritual ailments. Cacao was seen as a food of the gods, associated with fertility. The seeds were even used as currency by the Aztec, around 1200 AD.</p>




<p>For all its popularity in America, cacao was mostly ignored as a drink or food by the Spanish who conquored the region for almost 30 years. It wasn't until they decided to add sugar and spices like nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon that it became popular in Spain, around 1528 AD. The spread of chocolate across Europe was slow to start. It became popular in France in 1643 and the first &ldquo;Chocolate House&rdquo; opened in London in 1657.</p>

<p>Chocolate took hold faster in pre-Revolutionary New England, where the first chocolate factory was opened in 1765. Germany followed shortly with a factory in Berlin in 1792, and by 1800, chocolate was a major industry. The nineteeth century was huge for cocoa, with inventions like the cocoa press, fondant chocolate, and milk chocolate. Switzerland makes a name for themselves as a leader in chocolate production and quality througout the 1900's and America keeps chocolate in high regards, including it in army rations and sending it to space for astronauts. Once regarded as a food of the gods, cocoa is still clearly out of this world.</p>
