<h1>Wind Energy</h1>
<h2>The What, How, When, and Why of Wind Power</h2>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Wind Power refers to electricity converted from wind's kinetic energy by turbines. Wind power is classified as a renewable energy source and is nonpolluting.</p>

<p><strong>How:</strong> Turbines use a blade or rotor that is pushed by the wind and activates a drive train encased in a <em>nacelle</em>, or encloser. The energy produced by the turbine is stored in a battery to be used on demand. Small wind turbines can be used to provide power to individual houses. Larger turbines can be grouped together in areas called wind farms to provide more energy to a larger population or company.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Wind energy is one of the world's fastest-growing energy sources, but it has been used by people for centuries. From sails on ships to windmills that grind grain to the modern wind turbines that convert wind to electricity, people use the power of wind in amazing ways and will continue to do so for years to come. Wind power made up approximately 4% of the world's total electricity in 2016 and it is projected to increase to 20% by 2030. In short, the When of Wind Power is <em><strong>now.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> There are many benefits to wind power:
<ul>
<li> Cost-competitive.</li>
<li> Creates jobs.</li>
<li> Lessens dependence on other energy sources.</li>
<li> Provides possible income for land owners.</li>
<li> Clean.</li>
<li> Versatile.</li>
</ul>
As Frances Beinecke said, &ldquo;Wind and other clean, renewable energy will help end our reliance on fossil fuels and combat the severe threat that climate change poses to humans and wildlife alike.&rdquo;
