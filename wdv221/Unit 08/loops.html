<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>Please complete the following exercises using JavaScript loops as indicated.  Please place your code on this page. Use runtime scripts unless told otherwise. </p>
<p>1. Create a WHILE loop that will print out the  numbers 0 to 4 each on a seperate line.</p>
<p>
    <script> //1. While loop that prints 0 to 4 on a new line
        var x=0;		//Loop control variable, starts at 0
        while(x<=4)	{	//checks the variable before looping
            document.write(x + "<br/>");	//display the value of x each time through the loop and start a new line
            x++;				//increment x by one
        }
    </script> 
</p>
<p>2. Create a FOR loop that will print out the  numbers 4 to 0 each on a seperate line.</p>
<p>
    <script> //2. For loop that prints 4 to 0 on a new line
        for(let x = 4; x >= 0; x--) { //for loop variable, condition, and decrease for each loop through
            document.write(x + "<br/>");	//display the value of x on a new line each time through the loop
        }
    </script> 
</p>
<p>3. Create a loop that will print 1 to 5 each in its own paragraph element.</p>
<p>
    <script> //3. loop to print 1 to 5 in its own paragraph element
        var x=1;		//Loop control variable, starts at 1
        while(x<=5)	{	//checks the variable before looping
            document.write("<p>" + x + "</p>");	//display the value of x in a paragraph each time through the loop
            x++;		//increment x by one	
        }
    </script>    
</p>

<p>4. Create a loop that will print out the following numbers (5,10,15,20,25...) until one is greater than 40.</p>
<p>
    <script> //4. loop to print numbers 5 - 45, increasing by 5 each time
        var x=5;		//Loop control variable, starts at 5
        while(x<=45)	{	//checks the variable before looping
            if (x == 45) { //last item in list, no ", " at end
                document.write(x);
                x+=5;
            }
            else {
                document.write(x + ", ");	//display the value of x with a comma and space each time through the loop
                x+=5;   //increment x by 5
            }				
        }
    </script>    
</p>

<p>5. Create a loop that will print out  6 of the following messages (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc. ) as options within the drop down menu below.</p>
<p>
  <label>Select an Option! 
    <select name="select" id="select">        
    </select>
  </label>
</p>

<p>
    <script> //5. loop to create options titled Option 1 through Option 6 for drop-down menu
        var x=1;		//Loop control variable, starts at 1
        while(x<=6)	{	//checks the variable before looping
            let option = "Option " + x; //sets variable to hold option name which displays the value of x
            document.getElementById("select").innerHTML += "<option value=" + option + "> " + option + "</option>";	//add the option to the drop down list for every time looped
            x++;				//increment x	
        }
    </script>    
</p>
